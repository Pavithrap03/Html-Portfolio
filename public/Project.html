<h3>Smart Car Parking using IoT - Internet of Things</h3>
<p>Smart Car Parking System, leverages IoT technology to streamline parking management. Using sensors, the system detects available parking slots in real time and updates a cloud-based dashboard. This ensures efficient space utilization, reduces search time, and provides users with a seamless parking experience through automated monitoring and guidance.</p>
<h3>Smart Street Light using IoT</h3>
<p>My project, Smart Street Light System, utilizes IoT technology to optimize energy consumption. The system automatically adjusts street light intensity based on ambient light and motion detection. It integrates sensors and cloud connectivity to enable real-time monitoring, fault detection, and efficient energy management, contributing to smarter and more sustainable urban infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Smart Vacuum Cleaner</h3>
<p>My project, Smart Vacuum Cleaner, is an IoT-based automation system designed for efficient cleaning. It features RFID technology for room identification, cloud integration for tracking activities, and solar panels for self-charging. The system autonomously navigates, cleans, and optimizes energy usage, offering a sustainable and intelligent solution for modern housekeeping.</p>
